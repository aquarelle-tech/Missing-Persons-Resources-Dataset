# Missing Persons Datasets & Resources for AI Development and Investigation

## Manifesto

The purpose of this collection of links, documents and various resources is to assist in the creation and development of public and open software for the identification of missing persons, mainly from sources such as
 
 - Videos, images and audios published on the Internet, mainly by criminal organizations, groups and individuals who use kidnapping and violence of all kinds to try to profit from the multimedia content produced by these attacks on pornography sites, and the like.
 
 - Images or videos published on the Internet in social platforms such as Instagram, Youtube and similar where missing persons may appear directly or indirectly and identification in those media may offer clues to police forces and families for their location and rescue, if necessary.
 
 - Any other type of audiovisual content that can be used in an analysis algorithm such as videos taken from surveillance cameras, personal mobiles, news or private material of any kind.
